analogInCallback.js // Reads analog in on P1_19 and prints it via a callback.
blinkLED.c          // Blinks the USR3 LED via c
blinkLED.js         // Blinks the USR LEDs and P1_36
blinkLED.py         // Blinks one LED wired to P1_36 via python
fadeLED.js          // Fades the LED wired to P1_36 using the PWM.
input.js            // Responds to changes on P8_19 via a callback.
input2.js           // Responds to changes on P8_19 and P9_16 via callbacks.
