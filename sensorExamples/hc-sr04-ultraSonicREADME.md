# Demo: Reading a Distance Sensor (Variable Pulse Width Sensor)

You want to use a HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Range Sensor with BeagleBone Black.

The HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Range Sensor (shown in below) works by sending a trigger pulse to the _Trigger_ input and then measuring the pulse width on the _Echo_ output. The width of the pulse tells you the distance.

Wire the sensor as shown below. Note that the HC-SR04 is a 5 V
device, so the _banded_ wire (running from ```P9_7``` on the Bone to VCC on the range finder) attaches the HC-SR04 to the Bone's 5 V power supply.

This code is more complex than others, because we have to tell the device when to start measuring and time the return pulse.

HC-SR04 | Pin   | Bone  | Pocket
------- | ---   | ----  | ------
GND     | GND   | P9_1  | P2_15
V+      | 3.3V  | P9_3  | P1_14
trigger | out   | P9_15 | 
echo    | in    | P9_17 |
